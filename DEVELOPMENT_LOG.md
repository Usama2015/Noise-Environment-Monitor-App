**Key Algorithms Implemented:**

1. **Decibel Calculation:**
   ```python
   RMS = sqrt(mean(audio^2))
   dB = 20 * log10(RMS / reference) + calibration_offset
   ```

2. **Moving Average Filter:**
   ```python
   filtered[i] = mean(data[i-window/2 : i+window/2])
   ```

3. **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform):**
   ```python
   windowed_audio = audio * hamming_window
   fft_result = rfft(windowed_audio, n=2048)
   magnitudes = abs(fft_result)
   frequencies = rfftfreq(2048, 1/sample_rate)
   ```

4. **Spectral Features:**
   - Spectral Centroid: Weighted mean of frequencies
   - Spectral Spread: Standard deviation around centroid
   - Spectral Rolloff: Frequency containing 85% of energy

- Verified FFT produces correct frequency peaks
- Confirmed moving average filter smooths spikes

**Commands to run prototype:**
```bash
cd research/prototypes

### Session 3: Git Workflow Protocol and Phase 0 Commit

**Time:** Afternoon (Continued)
**Phase:** Phase 0 wrap-up + Git strategy documentation
**Team Member:** Git workflow enforcement setup

---

#### Activity 1: Git Workflow Protocol Addition

**What was done:**
- Added comprehensive Git Workflow Protocol section to PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Created mandatory Git usage guidelines for all future development
- Documented proper branching strategy enforcement

**Files modified:**
1. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
   - Added new section "üåø Git Workflow Protocol" (lines 625-810)
   - Includes: Critical Git Rules, Phase examples, commit requirements, safety net, enforcement
   - Updated Update Log table to version 1.1.0

**Key Content Added:**

**Critical Git Rules:**
- NEVER commit directly to `main` or `develop` (except minor docs on develop)
- ALWAYS use feature branches for ALL work
- Branch naming: `phase/X-name`, `feature/name`, `bugfix/name`, `experiment/name`

**Workflow Examples:**
- Phase 0: `git checkout -b phase/0-research` ‚Üí work ‚Üí merge to develop
- Phase 1: `git checkout -b phase/1-core-app` ‚Üí create feature branches ‚Üí merge back

**Commit Requirements:**
- Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): subject`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert
- Examples provided for each type

**Enforcement Section:**
- Claude AI MUST check branch before work
- MUST create appropriate branch if not on one
- MUST use conventional commits
- MUST document Git operations in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md

**Decisions made:**
- Added Git Workflow Protocol section to prevent future direct commits to main/develop
- User identified that Phase 0 work was committed directly to develop (violation of Git Flow)
- Going forward, ALL phases must use proper feature/phase branches

**Why this was added:**
- Previous Phase 0 work was committed directly to `develop` branch
- This violates Git Flow best practices defined in GIT_STRATEGY.md
- Need explicit enforcement protocol in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- Ensures all future development follows proper workflow

---

#### Activity 2: Phase 0 Work Commit

**What was done:**
- Staged all uncommitted Phase 0 work

   - Fix: Removed `--template react-native-template-typescript` flag

3. **Jest config typo:**
   - Error: "Unknown option 'coverageThresholds'"
   - Fix: Changed to `coverageThreshold` (singular)

4. **Missing Jest setup module:**
   - Error: Cannot find module '@testing-library/react-native/extend-expect'
   - Fix: Removed import (matchers now built-in to React Native Testing Library v12.4+)

5. **ESLint warnings for placeholder code:**
   - Warning: Unused parameters in TODO functions
   - Status: Expected warnings for placeholder code, not blocking

---

#### Activity 3: TypeScript Type Definitions

**What was done:**
- Created comprehensive type definitions for entire application
- Defined 8 core interfaces and types for domain models

**Files created:**

1. **mobile-app/src/types/index.ts** (115 lines)

**Types defined:**

```typescript
// Classification categories
export type NoiseClassification = 'Quiet' | 'Normal' | 'Noisy';

// Raw audio data from microphone
export interface AudioSample {
  samples: Float32Array;
  sampleRate: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Decibel reading with classification
export interface DecibelReading {
  value: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  classification: NoiseClassification;
}

// Complete noise reading with GPS
export interface NoiseReading {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  decibels: number;
  classification: NoiseClassification;
  latitude?: number;
  longitude?: number;
  locationName?: string;
}

// FFT frequency domain data
export interface FrequencyData {
  frequencies: number[];
  magnitudes: number[];
}

// Extracted audio features for ML
export interface AudioFeatures {
  spectralCentroid: number;
  spectralSpread: number;
  spectralRolloff: number;
  spectralFlatness: number;
  spectralEntropy: number;
  dominantFrequency: number;
  lowFreqRatio: number;
  midFreqRatio: number;
  highFreqRatio: number;
}

// GPS coordinates
export interface LocationCoordinates {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  accuracy: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Permission status
export type PermissionStatus = 'granted' | 'denied' | 'undetermined';
```

**Design decisions:**
- Used TypeScript interfaces for object types (more extensible)
- Used type aliases for union types (NoiseClassification, PermissionStatus)
- Optional GPS fields (latitude, longitude) to handle location unavailability
- Timestamp fields as Date objects (not strings) for better type safety

---

#### Activity 4: Placeholder Services Creation

**What was done:**
- Created placeholder services for future implementation steps
- Added comprehensive TODO comments explaining next steps
- All services throw "Not implemented yet" errors with step numbers

**Files created:**

1. **mobile-app/src/services/AudioService.ts**
   - Purpose: Handle microphone capture and permissions (Step 1.2)
   - Methods: `requestPermission()`, `startRecording()`, `stopRecording()`, `onAudioSample()`
   - TODO: Implement with react-native-audio or expo-av

2. **mobile-app/src/utils/DecibelCalculator.ts**
   - Purpose: Convert audio samples to dB SPL (Step 1.3)
   - Functions: `calculateDecibels()`, `calculateRMS()`
   - Formula documented: dB = 20 * log10(RMS / reference)

3. **mobile-app/src/utils/MovingAverageFilter.ts**
   - Purpose: Smooth noise readings (Step 1.4)
   - Class: `MovingAverageFilter` with sliding window
   - Function: `applyMovingAverage()`

**Why placeholders:**
- Establishes project structure early
- Documents implementation order (Step 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)
- Provides clear TODO targets for future work
- Enables TypeScript compilation to pass

---

#### Activity 5: Testing Configuration

**What was done:**
- Configured Jest testing framework with React Native preset
- Set up coverage thresholds and reporting
- Verified test infrastructure working

**Configuration details:**

**Coverage Thresholds (jest.config.js):**
```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 80,
    functions: 80,
    lines: 80,
    statements: 80
  }
}
```

**Test scripts (package.json):**

**Verification:**
```bash
cd mobile-app
npm test
# Output: 1 test suite passed, 1 test passed

npm run lint
# Output: Working (expected warnings for TODO code)
```

---

#### Activity 6: Documentation Creation

**What was done:**

#### Activity 1: Audio Library Research and Selection

**What was done:**
- Researched React Native audio recording libraries
- Evaluated compatibility with React Native 0.82 and TypeScript
- Selected react-native-audio-record for implementation

**Libraries Evaluated:**
1. **react-native-audio-record** (CHOSEN)
   - Focused on recording (not playback)
   - Direct access to PCM audio data via base64
   - Cross-platform (iOS/Android)
   - Lightweight with minimal dependencies
   - Real-time streaming with callbacks
   - Active maintenance

2. **expo-av**
   - Heavier, focused on playback
   - Requires Expo infrastructure
   - Not chosen for this project

3. **react-native-audio**
   - Older library
   - Less active maintenance
   - Not chosen

4. **@react-native-community/audio-toolkit**
   - More complex API
   - Larger footprint
   - Not chosen

**Decision:** react-native-audio-record v0.2.2

**Rationale:**
- Best fit for raw audio access
- Minimal overhead
- Real-time callbacks essential for live monitoring
- Well-documented TypeScript support

---

#### Activity 2: Library Installation and Configuration

**What was done:**
- Installed react-native-audio-record package
- Installed @types/node for Buffer support
- Updated Android permissions
- Updated iOS permissions

**Commands executed:**
```bash
cd D:/OtherDevelopment/INFS/mobile-app

# Install audio recording library
npm install react-native-audio-record

# Install Node.js types for Buffer
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

**Files modified:**

1. **mobile-app/package.json**
   - Added: `"react-native-audio-record": "^0.2.2"`
   - Added: `"@types/node": "^24.7.2"` (devDependencies)

2. **mobile-app/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**
   - Added: `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />`

3. **mobile-app/ios/NoiseMonitor/Info.plist**
   - Added microphone usage description:
   ```xml
   <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Noise Monitor needs access to your microphone to measure ambient noise levels and classify your environment.</string>
   ```

**Dependencies installed:** 2 packages
- react-native-audio-record: Core audio recording library
- @types/node: TypeScript definitions for Node.js Buffer

---

#### Activity 3: AudioService Implementation

**What was done:**
- Implemented complete AudioService class (340 lines)
- Singleton pattern for app-wide audio management
- Platform-specific permission handling (Android/iOS)
- Real-time audio streaming with callbacks
- Base64 to Float32Array conversion with PCM normalization
- Comprehensive error handling

**File created:**
**mobile-app/src/services/AudioService.ts** (340 lines)

**Key Implementation Details:**

**Audio Configuration:**
```typescript
sampleRate: 44100,        // Matches Python prototype
channels: 1,              // Mono audio
bitsPerSample: 16,        // 16-bit PCM
audioSource: 6,           // VOICE_RECOGNITION (Android)
wavFile: 'audio.wav'      // Temporary file name
```

**Core Methods Implemented:**

1. **requestPermission(): Promise<boolean>**
   - Platform-specific permission requests
   - Android: Uses PermissionsAndroid.request()
   - iOS: Handled automatically by system
   - Returns: true if granted, false if denied
   - Throws: AudioServiceError on failure

2. **startRecording(): Promise<void>**
   - Initializes audio recording library
   - Checks for permission before starting
   - Prevents duplicate recording attempts
   - Sets up audio data callback
   - Throws: AudioServiceError on failure

3. **stopRecording(): Promise<void>**
   - Stops active recording
   - Validates recording is active
   - Cleanup audio resources
   - Throws: AudioServiceError if not recording

4. **onAudioSample(callback): () => void**
   - Registers callback for audio samples
   - Supports multiple callbacks
   - Returns unsubscribe function
   - Isolates callback errors (won't crash service)

5. **getRecordingStatus(): boolean**
   - Returns current recording state
   - No side effects

6. **getConfig(): AudioConfig**
   - Returns immutable audio configuration
   - Prevents external modification

7. **clearCallbacks(): void**
   - Removes all registered callbacks
   - Useful for cleanup

8. **cleanup(): Promise<void>**
   - Stops recording if active
   - Clears all callbacks
   - Complete service reset

**Audio Sample Processing:**
```typescript
// Base64 PCM data ‚Üí Float32Array conversion
private base64ToFloat32Array(base64: string): Float32Array {
  const buffer = Buffer.from(base64, 'base64');
  const int16Array = new Int16Array(buffer.buffer);
  const float32Array = new Float32Array(int16Array.length);

  // Normalize 16-bit PCM to [-1.0, 1.0] range
  for (let i = 0; i < int16Array.length; i++) {
    float32Array[i] = int16Array[i] / 32768.0;
  }

  return float32Array;
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Custom `AudioServiceError` class
- Preserves original error context
- Specific error messages for each failure type
- Callback error isolation (logs but doesn't crash)

**Platform Differences:**
| Aspect | Android | iOS |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Permission Request | Programmatic (`PermissionsAndroid`) | System-handled |
| Permission Dialog | Customizable title/message | Standard system dialog |
| Audio Source | Configurable (VOICE_RECOGNITION) | Automatic |

- Fixed linting issues in placeholder files
- Created detailed implementation documentation
- Committed and pushed to remote repository
- **COMPLETED PHASE 1, STEP 1.2**

**Files Created:**
- src/services/AudioService.ts (340 lines)
- __tests__/AudioService.test.ts (488 lines)
- IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT_STEP_1.2.md (comprehensive report)

**Files Modified:**
- package.json (added 2 dependencies)
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (RECORD_AUDIO permission)
- ios/NoiseMonitor/Info.plist (microphone usage description)
- tsconfig.json (added node/jest types)
- .eslintrc.js (added coverage ignore pattern)
- src/utils/DecibelCalculator.ts (fixed linting)
- src/utils/MovingAverageFilter.ts (fixed linting)

**Dependencies Added:**
- react-native-audio-record@0.2.2
- @types/node@24.7.2

**Key Metrics:**
- Lines of implementation code: 340
- Lines of test code: 488
- Test/Code ratio: 1.44:1 (excellent)
- Tests passing: 26/26
- Coverage: 96.96%
- TypeScript errors: 0
- ESLint errors: 0

**Key Learnings:**
1. react-native-audio-record provides excellent raw audio access
2. Base64 PCM encoding requires Buffer for efficient decoding
3. Singleton pattern ideal for device-wide audio resource management
4. Platform-specific permission handling requires conditional logic
5. Callback error isolation prevents single bad callback from crashing service
6. Test coverage >95% achievable with comprehensive mocking

**Challenges Encountered:**
1. **Buffer availability** - Resolved by installing @types/node
2. **Audio callback signature** - Adjusted types to match actual API (string, not object)
3. **TypeScript types** - Used library's built-in types
4. **ESLint unused parameters** - Prefixed with underscore per convention

**Phase 1 Status:**
- Step 1.1: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (React Native Setup)
- Step 1.2: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Audio Capture)
- Step 1.3: ‚è≥ NEXT (Decibel Calculation)
- Step 1.4: ‚è≥ PENDING (Moving Average Filter)
- Step 1.5: ‚è≥ PENDING (FFT Implementation)
- Step 1.6: ‚è≥ PENDING (Threshold Classification)
- Step 1.7: ‚è≥ PENDING (Basic UI)

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin Step 1.3: Decibel Calculation
2. Implement calculateRMS() function
3. Implement calculateDecibels() function
4. Calibrate reference value with test audio
5. Write unit tests for decibel calculation
6. Integrate with AudioService for real-time dB display

**Ready to proceed:** Phase 1, Step 1.3 - Decibel Calculation

**AudioService API Ready for Step 1.3:**
```typescript
// Register callback to receive audio samples
AudioService.onAudioSample((sample: AudioSample) => {
  // sample.samples: Float32Array at 44100 Hz
  // sample.sampleRate: 44100
  // sample.timestamp: Date

  // Step 1.3: Calculate decibels from samples
  const dB = calculateDecibels(sample.samples);
  console.log(`${dB.toFixed(1)} dB`);
});
```
