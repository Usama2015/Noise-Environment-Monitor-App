## Part 1: Welcome & Introduction (0:00 - 0:05)

### 1.1 Warm Greeting
**[When participant arrives]**

> "Hi [Name]! Thank you so much for coming. I'm [Your Name], and I'll be guiding you through the testing session today. Did you find the place okay?"

**[Make small talk, make them comfortable - 30 seconds]**

### 1.2 Explain Study Purpose
**[Sit down together]**

> "So, today we're testing a mobile app that helps students find quiet study spaces on campus. The app measures noise levels using your phone's microphone and tells you if a place is quiet, normal, or noisy."
>
> "We're in the early stages of development, so your feedback will directly shape what we build next. There are no wrong answers - if something doesn't work or is confusing, that's valuable information for us."

### 1.3 Explain Process
> "Here's what we'll do today:
> - First, I'll have you sign a quick consent form
> - Then, we'll walk through 3 different locations on campus (quiet, normal, noisy)
> - You'll test the app in each location - I'll guide you through specific tasks
> - At the end, you'll fill out a quick survey about your experience
> - The whole thing should take about 30 minutes
> - As a thank you, you'll get a $10 Starbucks gift card
>
> Sound good?"

**[Wait for agreement]**

### 1.4 Set Expectations
> "A few important things:
> 1. **Think out loud** - As you use the app, tell me what you're thinking, what you're looking at, what you expect to happen. This helps me understand your experience.
>
> 2. **Be honest** - We want real feedback, not nice feedback. If something frustrates you, tell me! You won't hurt my feelings - you're helping us improve.
>
> 3. **No right or wrong** - This is a test of the APP, not a test of YOU. If you can't figure something out, that's the app's fault, not yours.
>
> 4. **I'm note-taking** - I'll be writing notes as we go. That's normal - I'm just recording what I observe.
>
> 5. **Questions?** - You can ask questions anytime, but sometimes I might say 'Let me see what you do first' because I want to see your natural reaction.
>
> Any questions before we start?"

**[Answer questions]**

### 1.5 Consent Form
**[Hand them consent form]**

> "Before we begin, I need you to read and sign this consent form. It basically says:
> - You're participating voluntarily
> - Your responses will be kept confidential
> - We might use anonymized quotes in our report
> - You can stop at any time
>
> Take a moment to read it, and sign at the bottom if you agree."

**[Wait for them to read and sign]**
**[You sign as witness]**
**[Give them a copy]**

> "Great! Let's get started."

## Part 2: Task 1 - First Launch & Permissions (0:05 - 0:08)

### 2.1 Hand Them Device
**[Currently in quiet location - library study room]**

> "Okay, here's the phone with the app already installed. The app icon says 'Noise Monitor' with a microphone symbol.
>
> For your first task: **Open the app and grant any permissions it requests.**
>
> Remember to think out loud - tell me what you're thinking as you do this."

**[Hand them device]**
**[Step back, let them work]**

### 2.2 Observe Silently
**[Watch for:]**
- ✓ Do they find the app icon easily?
- ✓ Do they tap it immediately or hesitate?
- ✓ Do they read the permission dialog?
- ✓ Do they grant permission without confusion?
- ✓ Any facial expressions (confusion, concern)?

**[Write notes]**

### 2.3 If They Ask Questions
**Q: "Is this safe? Why does it need microphone access?"**
> "What do you think? What's your instinct?"
[Let them answer, then explain]
> "The app needs the microphone to measure noise levels - that's the core feature. No audio is recorded or saved, it just analyzes the sound level in real-time."

**Q: "Should I allow it?"**
> "That's up to you - what would you normally do in this situation?"
[If they deny] "Okay, that's valuable feedback. Let me enable it manually for testing purposes."

### 2.4 After Permission Granted
**[If successful]**
> "Great! Now you should see the main screen. Take a moment to look at it - what do you see?"

**[Let them describe]**
**[Don't correct them, just listen and note]**

---

## Part 3: Task 2 - Start Monitoring in Quiet Location (0:08 - 0:13)

### 3.1 Give Task
> "Okay, your next task is to **start monitoring the noise level in this room.**

**[They should:]**
- Tap "Start Monitoring" button

### 3.3 Let Them Observe (30 seconds)
> "Let it run for about 30 seconds and watch what happens."

**[Silence - let them observe]**
**[After 30 seconds]**

### 3.4 Ask Questions
> "Okay, let's pause here. I'm going to ask you some questions about what you're seeing:
>
> **Q1:** What does the number at the top represent?"

**[Correct answer: Decibel level / noise level]**
**[Note if they know or guess correctly]**

> "**Q2:** What does the green badge mean? What is it telling you?"

**[Correct answer: The environment is quiet / low noise]**

> "**Q3:** On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you that this reading is accurate? 1 meaning 'not confident at all' and 5 meaning 'very confident'."

**[Record their answer: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5]**

> "**Q4:** Why did you give it that rating?"

**[Record reasoning]**

### 3.5 Point Out Features
> "Let me point out a few things you might have noticed:
> - [Point to decibel display] This shows the noise level in decibels
> - [Point to badge] This tells you the category - Quiet, Normal, or Noisy
> - [Point to description] This describes what type of noise it detected
> - [Point to confidence bar] This shows how confident the app is in its classification
>
> Does that make sense?"
