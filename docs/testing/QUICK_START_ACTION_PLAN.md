3. **Test the app yourself FIRST** - Walk through all 6 tasks before testing with participants
4. **Scout locations in advance** - Don't assume a place will be quiet/noisy
5. **Print extra materials** - Always have 2-3 extra copies of everything
6. **Arrive early** - 15 minutes before first session to set up
7. **Stay neutral** - Don't defend the app, just observe and listen
