## Quick Response Templates

### They ask: "What exactly does the app do?"
```
Great question! It's an app that measures noise levels using your phone's microphone. The idea is to help students find quiet places to study on campus. You'd just hold the phone in different locations and the app tells you if it's quiet, normal, or noisy. Super simple!
```

### They ask: "Do I need to prepare anything?"
```
Nope! Just bring yourself and your phone. We'll walk around campus for about 15 minutes, test the app at a few spots (library, cafeteria, etc.), then sit down for a quick 5-minute survey. That's it!
```

### They ask: "Is this safe/legitimate?"
```
Yes, totally safe! This is an official INFS course project at GMU. We'll meet in a public campus location, walk around public areas, and you'll sign a consent form. You can verify with my professor [Name] if you'd like. Also happy to answer any questions before we start!
```

### They ask: "Can I bring a friend?"
```
Your friend is welcome to walk with us, but we can only compensate participants who complete the full testing + survey. If they want to sign up too, they can use this link: [Form link]
